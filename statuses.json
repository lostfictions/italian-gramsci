  "DA FORMATION OF-A DE INTELLECTUALS",
  "Are intellectuals an autonomous and independent social group, or does every social group have its-a own particular specialised category of-a intellectuals?",
  "Da problem is da complex one, because of-a da variety of-a forms assumed to date by-a da real historical process of-a formation of-a da different categories of-a intellectuals. Da most important of-a dese forms are two:",
  [
    "1. Every social group, coming into existence on-a de original terrain of-a de essential function in-a da world of-a economic production, creates together with itself, organically, one or more strata of-a intellectuals which give it homogeneity and an awareness of-a its-a ownâ€¦",
    "â€¦function not only in-a de economic but also in-a da social and political fields."
  ],
  "Da capitalist entrepreneur creates alongside himself-a de industrial technician, da specialist in political economy, de organisers of-a da new culture, of-a da new legal system, etc.",
  [
    "It should be noted-a dat-a de entrepreneur himself represents a higher level of-a social elaboration, already characterised by-a da certain directive [dirigente ] and technical (i.e. intellectual) capacity: he must have a certain technical capacity, not only in-a da limitedâ€¦",
    "â€¦sphere of-a his activity and initiative but in other spheres as well, at least in-a doze which are closest to economic production."
  ],
  "He must be an organiser of-a masses of-a men; he must be an organiser of-a da \"confidence\" of-a investors in his business, of-a da customers for his product, etc. Capisce?",
  [
    "If not all entrepreneurs, at least an elite amongst them must have da capacity to be an organiser of-a society in general, including all its-a complex organism of-a services, right up to da state organism, because of-a da need to create da conditions most favourable to deâ€¦",
    "â€¦expansion of-a dere own class; or at-a da least-a dey must possess da capacity to choose da deputies (specialised employees) to whom to entrust-a dis activity of-a organising-a da general system of-a relationships external to da business itself."
  ],
  [
    "It can be observed-a dat-a da \"organic\" intellectuals which every new class creates alongside itself and elaborates in-a da course of-a its-a development, are for-a da most part \"specialisations\" of-a partial aspects of-a da primitive activity of-a da new social type which-aâ€¦",
    "â€¦da new class has brought into prominence.*"
  ],
  "(*Mosca's Elementi di Scienza Politico (new expanded edition, 1923) are worth looking at in-a dis connection. Mosca's so-called \"political class\" is nothing other than-a de intellectual category of-a da dominant social group.",
  "Mosca's concept of-a \"political class\" can be connected with Pareto's concept of-a de elite, which is another attempt to interpret-a da historical phenomenon of-a de intellectuals and-a dere function in-a da life of-a da state and of-a society.",
  "Mosca's book is de enormous hotch-potch, of-a da sociological and positivistic character, plus da tendentiousness of-a immediate politics which makes it less indigestible and livelier from a literary point of-a view. Mamma mia!",
  "Even feudal lords were possessors of-a da particular technical capacity, military capacity, and it is precisely from-a da moment at which-a de aristocracy loses its-a monopoly of-a technico-military capacity-a dat-a da crisis of-a feudalism begins.",
  "But-a da formation of-a intellectuals in-a da feudal world and in-a da preceding classical world is da question to be examined separately: dis formation and elaboration follows ways and means which must be studied concretely.",
  [
    "Thus it is to be noted-a dat-a da mass of-a da peasantry, although it performs an essential function in-a da world of-a production, no elaborate its-a own \"organic\" intellectuals, nor does it \"assimilate\" any stratum of-a \"traditional\" intellectuals, although it is from-a daâ€¦",
    "â€¦peasantry-a dat other social groups draw many of-a dere intellectuals and a high proportion of-a traditional intellectuals are of-a peasant origin."
  ],
  [
    "2. However, every \"essential\" social group which emerges into history out of-a da preceding economic structure, and as de expressio n of-a da development of-a dis structure, has found (at least in all of-a history up to da present) categories of-a intellectuals already inâ€¦",
    "â€¦existence and which seemed indeed to represent an historical continuity uninterrupted even by-a da most complicated and radical changes in political and social forms."
  ],
  [
    "Da most typical of-a dese categories of-a intellectuals is dat of-a de ecclesiastics, who for a long time (for a whole phase of-a history, which is partly characterised by-a dis very monopoly) held a monopoly of-a da number of-a important services: religious ideology, dat isâ€¦",
    "â€¦da philosophy and science of-a de age, together with schools, education, morality, justice, charity, good works, etc."
  ],
  "Da category of-a ecclesiastics can be considered-a da category of-a intellectuals organically bound to da landed aristocracy.",
  [
    "It had equal status juridically with-a de aristocracy, with which it shared-a de exercise of-a feudal ownership of-a land, and-a de use of-a state privileges connected with property.* But-a da monopoly held by-a de ecclesiastics in-a da superstructural field** no was exercisedâ€¦",
    "â€¦without a struggle or without limitations, and hence dere took place da birth, in various forms (to be gone into and studied concretely), of-a other categories, favoured and enabled to expand by-a da growing strength of-a da central power of-a da monarch, right up toâ€¦",
    "â€¦absolutism."
  ],
  "Thus we find-a da formation of-a da noblesse de robe, with its-a own privileges, a stratum of-a administrators, etc., scholars and scientists, theorists, non-ecclesiastical philosophers, etc. Che bene.",
  [
    "(*For one category of-a dese intellectuals, possibly-a da most important after-a de ecclesiastical for its-a prestige and-a da social function it performed in primitive societies, da category of-a medical men in-a da wide sense, dat is all-a doze who \"struggle\" or seem toâ€¦",

  "Dis self-assessment no is without consequences in-a de ideological and political field, consequences of-a wide-ranging import.",
  [
    "Da whole of-a idealist philosophy can easily be connected with-a dis position assumed by-a da social complex of-a intellectuals and can be defined as de expression of-a dat social Utopia by which-a de intellectuals think of-a themselves as \"independent\", autonomous, endowedâ€¦",
    "â€¦with a character of-a dere own, etc."

    "â€¦closely linked to Aristotle and Plato, but he no conceal, on-a de other hand, his links with senators Agnelli and Benni, and it is precisely here dat one can discern-a da most significant character of-a Croce's philosophy."

  "What are da \"maximum\" limits of-a acceptance of-a da term \"intellectual\"?",
  "Can one find a unitary criterion to characterise equally all-a da diverse and disparate activities of-a intellectuals and to distinguish-a dese at-a da same time and in an essential way from-a de activities of-a other social groupings?",
  [
    "Da most widespread error of-a method seems to me dat of-a having looked for-a dis criterion of-a distinction in-a de intrinsic nature of-a intellectual activities, rather than in-a de ensemble of-a da system of-a relations in which-a dese activities (and therefore deâ€¦",

  "Dere is no human activity from which every form of-a intellectual participation can be excluded: homo faber cannot be separated from homo sapiens.",

  "In-a da modern world, technical education, closely bound to industrial labour even at-a da most primitive and unqualified level, must form-a da basis of-a da new type of-a intellectual. Bene.",
